Ruby modules needed for rbot
============================

Core requirements
      tokyocabinet          for "tc" DB adaptor
                            http://1978th.net/tokyocabinet/
                            you can install Ruby bindings via "gem install tokyocabinet",
                            but this still requires libtokyocabinet to be installed system-wide
      bdb (berkeley db)      for "bdb" DB adaptor or converting from it
                            http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/bdb/
                            (which requires libdb4.x or better, formerly from
                            www.sleepycat.com, now at
                            http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/berkeley-db/index.html)
                            Most of the time you don't need to compile anything.
                            If you're running Linux, your distribution should
                            have a libdb-ruby packaged (or similar).
                            For Windows instructions, check at the bottom
                            of this file.

      iconv                 this is needed by the httputil object and by the IRC engine
                            to ensure consistent encoding across the bot

      net/http 1.2+
      net/https             (for debian, this will also need libopenssl-ruby)
      socket
      uri

Useful but fallback provided
      ruby-gettext 1.8.0+   http://www.yotabanana.com/hiki/ruby-gettext.html?ruby-gettext
                            optional; if installed rbot can use localized messages
      htmlentities          http://htmlentities.rubyforge.org/
                            optional; if installed rbot will use it to decode
                            HTML entities; if missing, an internal table with
                            the most common HTML entities will be used instead
      hpricot               http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/
                            optional, if installed rbot will used it to find
                            the first paragraph in HTML files; if missing,
                            regular expressions will be used instead

Running rbot on win32
=====================

You can install Ruby using the One-Click Ruby installer, available from
http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/

You can find a precompiled version of the bdb package for ruby here
http://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/binaries/mingw/1.8/ext/bdb-0.5.1-i386-mingw32-1.8.tar.gz

When you unpack the archive (e.g. using WinZip or 7-Zip or any other tool
of your choice) you'll notice that it contains the following directory structure:
  usr
   +---local
         +---doc
         +---lib
and you have to move the doc and lib folders (and all their contents) in the folder
where you installed Ruby (typically C:\Ruby\)
