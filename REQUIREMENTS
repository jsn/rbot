Running rbot on win32
=====================

You can install Ruby using the One-Click Ruby installer, available from
http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/

You can find a precompiled version of the bdb package for ruby here
http://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/binaries/mingw/1.8/ext/bdb-0.5.1-i386-mingw32-1.8.tar.gz

When you unpack the archive (e.g. using WinZip or 7-Zip or any other tool
of your choice) you'll notice that it contains the following directory structure:
  usr
   +---local
         +---doc
         +---lib
and you have to move the doc and lib folders (and all their contents) in the folder
where you installed Ruby (typically C:\Ruby\)
